Thank you for purchasing/downloading one of my musics.
By doing that, you are supporting the artist to keep doing his good stuffs.

Track:       Stroll at Night
dB peak:     -1.1 dB
Full Lenght: 02:24

     INSTRUCTIONS:

****The available formats are: WAV (highest quality, but heavy) and OGG (great quality, a lot lighter).

****Inside the WAV and OGG files you will find 3 files with different extensions in their names:

"_intro" contains just the songs introduction, and SHALL NOT be looped!
"_loop" is the part you CAN loop.
"_full" is the whole song. I added a fade-out at the end for a smooth ending. You can loop it too, but 
it won't be as fluid as the "_loop" file. 


(OPTIONAL FEATURE FOR "_intro" AND "_loop")
****Inside the root folder, you will notice two C# files called "MusicManager" and "BGMController".
They are made to manage the transiction from "_intro" to "_loop".

1. The "MusicManager" can be left anywhere as long it's inside your Assets folder!
2. You may attach the "BGMController" on any GameObject within your scene.
3. Select the GameObject you attached the script, and check it's properties on Inspector.
4. There will be two fields where you can insert Audio Clips("Intro" and "Loop").
5. You can leave the "Intro" field in blank and just fill the "Loop". It will play and loop automatically.

These two scripts were made by Chaoseiro and I have permission from him to use them in my Asset
